Project Nmae: Stock Investing Club

Stack: Python

Descripion: I have always been passionate about invsting in stocks and would love to ahve a solution that would quicklytell me if I should buy/sell/hold a stock. To do this, thre are three very improtant data points that I look at for stocks: Forward P2, Enterprise Value to EBITDA, and ENTERPRISE Value to Revenue. These datapoints will come from an API: https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/ . Then, based on conditional, if/then logic, the I will put together a formula to detemine whether to buy/sell/hold absed on these three datapoints. 

Multiples users can enter their favorite stocks and see whether they should buy/sell/hold. This is an investment club, so it's a place where friends can brainstorm ideas.

MVP Features:
1. Summary table of stocks that users have added and the recommended buy/sell/hold displayed.
2. View detialed information about a given stock (Forward P/E, Enterprise Value to EBITDA, and ENTERPRISE Value to RevenuE).
3.Only users who added a given stock can edit the comments they added about the stok or delete the stock.

Non-MVP Features:
1. The color of each row on the summary table will be determined based on whether the stock is a buy/hold/sell.
2, News articles only relevant to wehther a user should buy/selll/hold will be avaialble for each stock on the summary table.
3. Other users can "like" someone's stock idea and add their own comments to someone else's stock idea.
